INTRODUCTION
------------

Palmyra is a cloud-based configurable and user-friendly platform for morphology and syntax 
annotation through dependency-tree visualization. It is designed to be highly persistent through
cloud storage, and comes shipped with an Arabic dependency parser that generates accurate trees.
Palmyra provides default configuration files so that users can annotate 
using predefined formalisms, and a number of user-friendly
features to support annotators.

Palmyra has been designed with morphologically rich languages in mind, 
and thus has a number of features to support the complexities of these languages, 
especially for supporting easy change of morphological tokenization through edits, 
additions, deletions and splits/merges of words. 
It can also be used to annotate a multitude of linguistic features. 
Palmyra uses an intuitive drag-and-drop metaphor for editing tree structures. 
Palmyra can be configured to be used with any dependency representation.

You can try out the Palmyra demo (Version 3.0, Release Date 06-MAR-2024) from https://camel-lab.github.io/palmyra/index.html
