INTRODUCTION
------------

Palmyra is a configurable platform independent graphical dependency tree visualization and editing software. Palmyra has been designed with morphologically 
rich languages in mind, and thus has a number of features to support the complexities of these languages, especially for supporting easy change of 
morphological tokenization through edits, additions, deletions and splits/merges of words. It can also be used to annotate a multitude of linguistic 
features. Palmyra uses an intuitive drag-and-drop metaphor for editing tree structures. Palmyra can be configured to be used with any dependency 
representation.

This resource was developed at the Computational Approaches to Modeling Language (CAMeL) Lab in New York University Abu Dhabi.

Palmyra is built on top of EasyTree (https://github.com/alexalittle/easytree).

FEATURES
--------

- View and edit dependency trees in any representation.
- Use intuitive drag-and-drop graphics.
- POS tags and relation labels are edtibale using button clicks or shortcut keys.
- Branches are collapsable to control tree size for easier display.
- Configurable for annotating any linguistic features.
- Script-agnostic and language-agnostic. (Compatible with all UTF-8 characters; right-to-left language support).
- Display a searchable list of the trees.
