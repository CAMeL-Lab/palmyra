            <p>FAQ:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h5>I got an alert: "Your browser will not support EasyTree!" Why?</h5>
                    <p id="faq">You are using an outdated browser, and EasyTree will not have the support functions to operate properly. Try updating your browser or using a different one.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Why aren't the graphics showing?</h5>
                    <p id='faq'>Check that main.css, the fonts folder, and the bkgds folder are all present in the package. If you have made changes to the CSS file, double-check that they are valid CSS.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>How do I change the tree display settings?</h5>
                    <p id="faq">Click the "SETTINGS" button on the tree editor toolbar. There are various display options and a reset button. Changes to settings are shown in real time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>How do I change the part-of-speech labels?</h5>
                    <p id="faq">Click the "KEY" button on the tree editor toolbar. This displays the current POS settings. Click "Customize" to change the labels, and "Done" to apply the changes. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Why is my sentence backwards?</h5>
                    <p id='faq'>If you created your JSON files using makejson.py, try toggling your "reverse" argument settings (i.e., add or remove "reverse" at the end of your command line arguments). 
                        Otherwise, recall that JSON input files must be ordered in the desired sentence order. If your language is right-to-left, this means that {"name": "." ...} should be the first child of "root". See examples.<br><br>
                        If you are entering a phrase, make sure you are entering the phrase as it would normally be read (i.e. don't alter or reverse it). If you still experience problems, report the issue via the <a href='https://github.com/alexalittle/easytree.git'>GitHub repository.</a></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Why don't my download files have an extension?</h5>
                    <p id='faq'>You need to specify the filename with its extension in the filename field. If you want the output to be a JSON file, add ".json" to your desired filename.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Why can't I label paths to the 'root' node?</h5>
                    <p id='faq'>Within the program, the 'root' node acts as a placeholder and has special properties. Labeling paths to 'root' is blocked because those labels interfere with the program's function. Besides, 'root' is a meaningless node so you really shouldn't have labels for its child paths!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Why can't I change the colors in the part-of-speech key?</h5>
                    <p id='faq'>This functionality is in the works for future editions of Easy Tree. For now, the palette is designed to be distinctive and colorblind-safe.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Why doesn't "CLEAR" reset the part-of-speech labels?</h5>
                    <p id='faq'>"CLEAR" just removes the tree data. To reset all settings, use the "RESET" button. To reset only POS settings or tree display settings, open the relevant menu and click "Reset All".</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>How do I close toolbar windows once I'm finished?</h5>
                    <p id="faq">If a window does not automatically close, click the toolbar button once more to close. Most windows also include a "close" button.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>What if the standard font doesn't display my language well?</h5>
                    <p id='faq'>You can change the font under "SETTINGS". Currently, choices are limited to web-safe fonts and the standard font, "Copse".</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Why do I get the pop-up 'Sorry, something went wrong!'?</h5>
                    <p id='faq'>Double-check your JSON file -- are there any typos? Do you have a single "root" node? Does every node have a "name" value? Are there extra brackets or commas?<br><br>
                        If you previously saved your tree and are trying to reload it, double-check the brackets and commas in the JSON file.<br><br>
                        If you still can't find a problem, or you think it's a regular expression error, please report the issue via the <a href='https://github.com/alexalittle/easytree.git'>GitHub repository.</a></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Can I make changes to the Easy Tree program?</h5>
                    <p id="faq">Absolutely! Feel free to change the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files as much as you want.</p>
                </li>
                                <li>
                    <h5>What is the license for Easy Tree?</h5>
                    <p id="faq">Easy Tree is provided with a CC BY-SA 4.0 license (as required by some of its design elements) and with a BSD-3 license (as required by some of its Javascript source packages). You can find these licenses in the "licenses" folder of Easy Tree.</p>
