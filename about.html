            PALMYRA is a highly configurable platform independent graphical dependency tree visualization and editing software. PALMYRA has been specifically designed for morphologically rich languages and thus has a number of features to support the complexities of these languages, and especially supporting easy change of morphological tokenization through edits, additions, deletions and splits/merges of words. It can also be used to annotate a multitude of linguistic features. PALMYRA uses an intuitive drag-and-drop metaphor for editing tree structures. Palmyra can be configured to be used with any dependency representation. 

            This demo is of Palmyra 2.0, an enhanced version of Palmyra as described in Javed et. al. (2018)
