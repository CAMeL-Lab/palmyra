            PALMYRA is a platform independent graphical dependency tree visualization and editing software. PALMYRA has been specifically designed for morphologically rich languages and thus has a number of features to support the complexities of these languages, and especially supporting easy change of morphological tokenization through edits, additions, deletions and splits/merges of words. PALMYRA uses an intuitive drag-and-drop metaphor for editing tree structures and uses pop-up boxes for POS and Link Label tagging. 

            <br><br>

            Palmyra is built on top of EasyTree which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/alexalittle/easytree">https://github.com/alexalittle/easytree</a>
