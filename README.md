INTRODUCTION
------------

PALMYRA is a platform independent graphical dependency tree visualization and editing software. PALMYRA has been specifically designed for morphologically rich languages and thus has a number of features to support the complexities of these languages, and especially supporting easy change of morphological tokenization through edits, additions, deletions and splits/merges of words. PALMYRA uses an intuitive drag-and-drop metaphor for editing tree structures and uses pop-up boxes for POS and Link Label tagging. 

This demo is based on the work described in Javed et. al. (2018). This resource was developed at the Computational Approaches to Modeling Language (CAMeL) Lab in New York University Abu Dhabi.

Palmyra is built on top of EasyTree (https://github.com/alexalittle/easytree).

FEATURES
--------

- View and edit dependency trees using drag-and-drop graphics.
- Collapse branches of tree to control tree size.
- Label dependency relationships by clicking on links.
- Script-agnostic and language-agnostic. (Compatible with all UTF-8 characters; right-to-left language support).
Added by Arfath
- Node distances are adjusted based on word length.
- Tree shrinks as nodes are collapsd.
- POS tag moved below word to minimize intersection with edge lines.
