INTRODUCTION
------------

PALMYRA is a highly configurable platform independent graphical dependency tree visualization and editing software. PALMYRA has been specifically designed for morphologically rich languages and thus has a number of features to support the complexities of these languages, and especially supporting easy change of morphological tokenization through edits, additions, deletions and splits/merges of words. It can also be used to annotate a multitude of linguistic features. PALMYRA uses an intuitive drag-and-drop metaphor for editing tree structures. Palmyra can be configured to be used with any dependency representation. 

This demo is of Palmyra 2.0, an enhanced version of the work described in Javed et. al. (2018). 

This resource was developed at the Computational Approaches to Modeling Language (CAMeL) Lab in New York University Abu Dhabi.

Palmyra is built on top of EasyTree (https://github.com/alexalittle/easytree).

FEATURES
--------

- View and edit dependency trees in any representation.
- Use intuitive drag-and-drop graphics.
- POS tags and relation labels are edtibale using button clicks or shortcut keys.
- Branches are collapsable to control tree size for easier display.
- Configurable for annotating any linguistic features.
- Script-agnostic and language-agnostic. (Compatible with all UTF-8 characters; right-to-left language support).
- Display a searchable list of the trees.
